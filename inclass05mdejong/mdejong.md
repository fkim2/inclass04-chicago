## Rice, Noodles, and Bread: Commonalities

What could rice, noodles, and bread possibly have in common? Is it, perhaps, that they are all delicious? That nutritionalists often tell you to eat less of them? That they're white-ish and squishy? All of those things are, of course, true. But that is not all. Though rice, noodles, and bread are all have their own histories, preparations, and nutritional values, they share a critical common function in many different cultures throughout the world: that of staple starches. This means that they make up a large portion of people's diets, providing a plentiful supply of carbohydrates and calories. With this common function in mind, let us look into how these staple starches came to be, how they're made, and what they can do for our bodies, starting with the oldest of them all.
