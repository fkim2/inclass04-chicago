# Chosen Topics and Their Commonalities 
* Longboard
	* A type of sports equipment similar to, but not the same as, a skateboard. It often is longer than a skateboard. It tends to be faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising and downhill racing, known as longboarding, rather than skateboarding.
* Skateboard
	* A skateboard is a type of sports equipment used primarily for the activity of skateboarding. It usually consists of a specially designed maplewood board combined with a polyurethane coating used for making smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood.A skateboard is moved by pushing with one foot while the other remains on the board, or by pumping one's legs in structures such as a bowl or half pipe. 
* Penny Board
	* A Penny board is a type of plastic skateboard, known within the industry as a short cruiser. Cruisers are similar to skateboards but have a different shape and often times composition. 

# History of Longboarding

The life of longboarding started in approximately the 1955s.[1] The idea of longboarding originated from surfers in Hawaii that wanted to take their surfing hobby to land when the waves were too small to surf.[1] Surfers then figured out a way of achieving their goal of bringing surfing to land by customizing their skateboards. They would grab a piece of thick plywood and shape it into a smaller version of a surfboard, then screw the trucks and wheels to the decks and head out to small hills to imitate the same moves they would do if they were out surfing.

During the 1970s, a small group of longboarders honed their techniques. Some longboarders from this period were profiled in a 1978 SkateBoarder magazine article entitled Cult of the Longboard.[2] These pioneers saw longboarding as a form of self-expression, and were influenced by surfing. However, despite the advent of polyurethane wheels (referred to as "thane" by longboarders[3]), longboarding did not reach a high degree of prevalence during the 1970s.[4]

Longboards lived on as an underground sport with home hobbyists continuing to make boards in their garages or strap trucks onto snowboard decks using old Kryptonic wheels from the 1970s or roller skating wheels.[citation needed]

In the early 1990s, Sector 9 started mass-producing and selling longboards.[5] The 1990s also saw a change in truck technology: reverse kingpins made longboarding more stable.[citation needed]

The Internet has made it possible for small groups of skateboarders to communicate with each other and also gain an audience they might not have had locally, allowing the sport to grow further.[citation needed] Multiple subbranches of longboarding exist with relatively small but hardcore groups of adherents like slalom, LDP (long distance pushing/pumping), downhill, dance, freeriding, technical hardwheel sliding and more.

Besides diversifying into many "species", longboarding itself has also come back around full circle and is embracing more street oriented tricks and cross over events using ramps too as well as embracing its earlier beginnings in slalom, ditch skating and just speed itself and cornering.[citation needed]

A longboard, generally considered to be longer that a standard skateboard, is now synonymous with any skateboard that ranges in sizes. In general a skateboard that ranges from the size of a persons foot to 22 inches is called a Penny board. Made popular by the plastic resin boards first created in 1973. From there the skateboard branches into two categories, longboard and skateboard. These names have less to do with the length and more to do with the use. The length of a longboard does affect performance with most high performance boards ranging from 32-45 inches. Carving boards can range in size from 24"- 6' long. The most popular length-range is about 32 to 60 inches. (Average skateboards are 28- 32 inches, with most being about 31-31.5 inches long.[6]

As well as usually being longer than a trick deck skateboard, longboards are typically equipped with larger, softer wheels which afford a smoother, faster ride.[7] However, depending on the durometer of the wheels used, it can be slower. There are many different uses for longboards, as shown below. Since longboards use softer bushings than a typical tech skateboard, carving is generally easier. Most longboards will use trucks with a much lower angle for enhanced turning. The trucks are often wider and will turn much sharper than skateboard trucks. Wider trucks also offer better stability. Some trucks use springs instead of bushings, such as Seismic trucks, or Original trucks. Original trucks also feature a wave-cam mechanism to control the lean and turn of the truck.

# History of Skateboarding

The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.[9] An American WAC, Betty Magnuson, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with roller skate wheels attached to them in late 1944.[10]

Skateboarding, as we know it, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s,[citation needed] when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called "sidewalk surfing" - a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.

By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called "Surf's Up" in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.

As the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, The Quarterly Skateboarder was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:

Today's skateboarders are founders in this sport—they're pioneers—they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding—its being made now—by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction.

The magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as Skateboarder in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.

One of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of Life magazine[21] in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—The Mike Douglas Show, What's My Line? and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, & Jim Fitzpatrick.

The growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $10 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965 (Weyland, 2002:28). By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.

# History of Penny Boarding

Some of the earliest plastic skateboards were created in 1978 by Larry Stevenson,a former Venice Beach lifeguard, who developed a line of plastic boards for his brand Makaha. In the 1990s, other plastic skateboard brands such as Stereo Skateboards, Krooked Skateboards and Globe emerged on the plastic skateboard market. Ben Mackay created the Penny board in 2010, from which the brand Penny Skateboards was born.The idea behind the creation of the company was inspired by Mackay’s first ever skateboard, a small plastic cruiser his father bought for him at a garage sale, when he was just five years old.

Islamov first started manufacturing and designing his own skateboards to sell to local skate shops. Drawing on woodworking and sales skills handed down from his father, he was determined to fulfill his dream of creating his own skateboard brand. Mackay began experimenting with different shapes and types of boards. He used a variety of materials, such as fiberglass and carbon inserts, as an alternative to timber. The signature durable and responsive characteristics of the Penny board was created by testing out plastic prototype boards. The strength and natural flex of Penny’s plastic formula is what sets Penny boards apart from other types of plastic skateboards.
